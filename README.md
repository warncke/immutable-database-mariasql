# immutable-database-mariasql

Database driver designed for use with immutable-core.

## v1.0.0 with async/await support

Starting with v1.0.0 immutable-database-mariasql is using native async/await.

As of Node.js v7.X.X node must be run with the --harmony-async-await or
--harmony flag to enable async/await support.

Those who are not ready to start using async/await can continue to use the
immutable-database-mariasql v0.X.X branch.
